## One Page Summary

Software App idea:  
**I Don’t Know** - **IDK**

  We will be developing a mobile device application written primarily in C++. Our app, “I Don’t Know” will help indecisive users decide on what to eat.  Our expectation for this app is to limit the user from the thousands of options presented to them at once when they search for options to eat on Yelp or Google. Our app will provide a simple UI for easy navigation. It will ask a few simple questions on what type of food you may be interested in at the time utilizing mostly pictures to minimize brain power. The answered questions will narrow down the options automatically for the user and present them 2-3 food options tailored to how they answered the previous questions. After the user makes their decision based on the app’s tailored options, it will be able to provide them with directions to the location they chose.

  Our first five features we will be focusing on in the first phase of development will be our decision tree diagram that leads the user to the result, having the time affect what meal type is suggested, an “I don’t know” button for those who are truly indecisive and can’t choose between the options provided, an initial option of choosing to eat in or out which affects the current branch, implementing a user class, and a way to record the foods that our user interacts with the most to be in a suggestion list.

  Our clients who are using our app are those who are indecisive, hungry, and short on time. Our app will be available for mobile devices which will allow our users to access it on the go. This app will also provide users who are unfamiliar with the area a tailored list of food options for them to eat at with directions to help them get there. The application will be a mobile application and accessed internally.

***What information do you need from your client?***
 
Now, for today's activity, you ll assume that you are the end-user or you are interviewing the end-user and client to gather information, you can focus on:

- Suggestion based on time of day
- I don’t know button(lottery, randomization)
- Taste survey(questionnaire)
- Eating out or dining in(goes on different branch of tree diagram)
- User class(profile)
- Record responses for suggestion

**Client Needs**
- The client will need help to decide what to eat
- Who will the users be?	
- Anyone who is indecisive and hungry or those short on time looking for a cheap alternative
