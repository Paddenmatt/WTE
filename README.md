# One Page Summary

### Software App idea:
**I Don’t Know** - **IDK**

   We will be developing a mobile device application written primarily in C++. Our app, “I Don’t Know” will help indecisive users decide on what to eat.  Our expectation for this app is to limit the user from the thousands of options presented to them at once when they search for options to eat on Yelp or Google. Our app will provide a simple UI for easy navigation. It will ask a few simple questions on what type of food you may be interested in at the time utilizing mostly pictures to minimize brain power. The answered questions will narrow down the options automatically for the user and present them 2-3 food options tailored to how they answered the previous questions. After the user makes their decision based on the app’s tailored options, it will be able to provide them with directions to the location they chose.

   Our first five features we will be focusing on in the first phase of development will be our decision tree diagram that leads the user to the result, having the time affect what meal type is suggested, an “I don’t know” button for those who are truly indecisive and can’t choose between the options provided, an initial option of choosing to eat in or out which affects the current branch, implementing a user class, and a way to record the foods that our user interacts with the most to be in a suggestion list.

  Our clients who are using our app are those who are indecisive, hungry, and short on time. Our app will be available for mobile devices which will allow our users to access it on the go. This app will also provide users who are unfamiliar with the area a tailored list of food options for them to eat at with directions to help them get there. The application will be a mobile application and accessed internally.

-----------------------------------

# In this assignment, you will expand the idea... and narrow the ideas down…

## What kind of project is that?
- App

## What is the programming language you need to know? 
- C++
- Java
- Swift
- Python

## How is the GUI? (sketches)
- https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/19ZmZmesrbhwjii9KatCmCRinIuV1BcAWpwgcPGW1G8M/edit?usp=sharing

## Why this project? 
- We want to help those who have trouble deciding what to eat find food and be saved

-----------------------------------

# What information do you need from your client?
Now, for today's activity, you ll assume that you are the end-user or you are interviewing the end-user and client to gather information, you can focus on:

## **What is your expectation from this software/project/application?** 
- The client wants to tackle the problem of people’s indecisiveness when it comes to what they want to eat.
- A simple UI that minimizes confusion and makes decisions easier
- It will help people choose what they want to eat and If they cant choose, we’ll choose for them
- It will help direct people to the place they want to eat (maps)
- It will ...

## **What are the main features needed during the first phase (5)?** 
- Suggestion based on time of day
- I don’t know button(lottery, randomization)
- Taste survey(questionnaire)
- Eating out or dining in(goes on different branch of tree diagram)
- User class(profile)
- Record responses for suggestion

## **Client Needs**
- The client will need help to decide what to eat
- Who will the users be?	
- Anyone who is indecisive and hungry or those short on time looking for a cheap alternative

## **From where will you need access to the application? (internal or external)**
- Internal

## **What is the goal of this project?**
- To provide a service for people who are short on time and do not want to waste it deciding on what to eat.

# DISCORD PINS

### 1. Paul Inventado's Swift Programming class - Initial Guidance
> so in my swift class, to get started we had to:

__**Start the design document**__
> google doc containing the requirement questions (1-13 for this SWE class)

__**Add everyone to a github repo (project code)**__
> - each member of the team gets their own branch
> - 3 types of branches
>    - 1 master branch (deployment, receives least amt of pull requests)
>    - 1 dev branch (the branch that each of us make pull requests on, master will take from this at end)
>    - 5 team member branches (each member gets their own, updating it often to match the dev branch)
>    - `Personally I think just ONE branch (Main) is needed for this project (Brian)`
  
__**Make an excel/google sheet, to log in code edits (documentation log)**__

__**Team hangout/review the items above and learn how each of us will utilize them**__
> - project manager leads this
> - PM explains how to log in documentation on google sheet
> -  how to properly commit/pull request/merge/use branches on github project repo
> - how to make changes on the google design document
